# Chronicle tutorial

This repository contains a comprehensive guide for a dApp developer or
system administrator to plan and set up a server and start using
Chronicle for data collection from an EOSIO blockchain, such as Telos
mainnet.

This development is sponsored by [Telos
blockchain](https://www.telos.net/) community as part of [Worker
Proposal #95](https://chainspector.io/governance/worker-proposals/95).

[Chronicle](https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/eos-chronicle) is a
software package for receiving and decoding the data flow that is
exported by `state_history_plugin` of `nodeos`, the blockchain node
daemon [developed by Block One](https://developers.eos.io/).
